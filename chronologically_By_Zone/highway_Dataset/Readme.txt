This folder contains a vehicles' highway mobility dataset on a region of 1 KM2 for 24 hours (ordered chronologically), extracted from the Koln Dataset of the TAPASCologne Project.
TAPASCologne is an initiative of the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center (ITS-DLR), aimed at reproducing, with the highest level of realism possible, car traffic in the greater urban area of the city of Cologne, in Germany. 

Seven parameters are provided :
- time (with 1-second granularity)
- vehicle identifier 
- position on the two-dimensional plane (x and y coordinates in meters)  
- speed (im meters per second)
- acceleration
- jerk: jerk or jolt is the rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time. It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction)
