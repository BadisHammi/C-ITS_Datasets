This folder contains multiple datasets: vehicles' urban moility dataset and  vehicles' highway mobility dataset, each for a region of 1 KM2 for 24 hours, extracted from the Koln Dataset of the TAPASCologne Project. The datasets are presented in two formats: (1) collected data by vehicle and (2) collected data on a region defined where the activity of the vehicles is presented chronologically.

TAPASCologne is an initiative of the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center (ITS-DLR), aimed at reproducing, with the highest level of realism possible, car traffic in the greater urban area of the city of Cologne, in Germany.

Seven parameters are provided :
- time (with 1-second granularity)
- vehicle identifier
- position on the two-dimensional plane (x and y coordinates in meters)
- speed (im meters per second)
- acceleration
- jerk: jerk or jolt is the rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time. It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction)
